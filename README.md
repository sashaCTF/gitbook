# pwn-rev-notes

Welcome! This is a gitbook for housing my notes about binary exploitation and reverse engineering, where I go over a lot of what I know, so that you can learn something, and so that I don't forget this.

This will mainly cover binary exploitation and reverse engineering on _linux_, as I don't know that much about windows, however a lot of these concepts are used on windows as well.
