# What is reverse engineering?

Reverse engineering is where you try to uncover what some code does, or what an executable does, to figure out how it works. For example, you could be given an ELF file, which is a linux executable file, which prompts you for a password, and you want to be ale to bypass it. You could use reverse engineering to find out what the password it's looking for, so you can input it and pass the check. This is a simple example, however it can be used for much more advanced programs
