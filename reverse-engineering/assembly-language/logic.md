# Logical Operations

Assembly uses logic gates as instructions, and we'll go over how it uses them with the instructions: `and`, `or`, `xor`, `test`, `not`.

## and

`and` is a logic gate where both operands have to be `true` (or `1`) to return `true` (or `1`). It will do the operation, and store the result in the first operand. Syntax is as follows:

```asm
and destination, source
```

Logic table is as shown:

| A | B | Result |
|---|---|--------|
| 0 | 0 | 0      |
| 1 | 0 | 0      |
| 0 | 1 | 0      |
| 1 | 1 | 1      |
