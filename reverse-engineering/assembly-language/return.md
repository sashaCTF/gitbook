# Returning

Returing is when the function reaches the end of the code it had to execute, so it returns a value, and goes back to where it was called, or, if it was main, it will terminate. In assembly, this is done with the `ret` instruction, and it is important to know how this works

## What does `ret` do?

`ret` is used to jump back to where it was called, and continue execution there instead, as it has finished executing code in that function.
